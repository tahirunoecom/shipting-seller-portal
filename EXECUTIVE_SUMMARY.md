# Shipting Seller Portal - Executive Summary

## What Is This?

**Shipting is an all-in-one e-commerce platform that lets store owners sell products through WhatsApp, manage orders visually, and deliver using either their own team or a network of local delivery partners - all while administrators oversee quality and payments.**

---

## The Problem We Solve

1. **Customers prefer WhatsApp** - 2+ billion users check it daily, but most stores don't sell there
2. **Order management is messy** - Sellers juggle spreadsheets, notes, and messages
3. **Finding delivery help is hard** - Small stores can't afford full-time drivers
4. **Getting paid is complicated** - Manual payment tracking and bank transfers
5. **No oversight** - Platform owners need to ensure quality and prevent fraud
